# CNAPP DASHBOARD

### This project is a React application powered by Vite. The following instructions will guide you through the steps to clone the repository, set up the project, and run it on your local machine.

### Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your local machine:

## Git: Version control system to clone repositories.
Node.js: JavaScript runtime environment. It's recommended to use the latest LTS version.
npm (comes with Node.js) or yarn: Package manager to install dependencies.
Getting Started

### Clone the Repository
To clone the repository to your local machine, open your terminal and run the following command:

bash: 
git clone <url of git repo>

### Navigate to the Project Directory
After cloning the repository, navigate to the project's directory:

cd repository-name

### Install Dependencies

Once inside the project directory, install the project dependencies:

Using npm:

## npm install
Or using yarn:
## yarn install
This command will install all the required packages as listed in the package.json file.

### Run the Development Server
After the dependencies are installed, you can run the development server. Vite will start a local server, and you can view the application in your browser.

Using npm:

## npm run dev
Or using yarn:
## yarn dev

##  Open the Application
Once the server is running, you can open your web browser and navigate to:



http://localhost:5173
This will load the React application in your browser.
