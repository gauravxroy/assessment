# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

# CNAPP DASHBOARD

### This project is a React application powered by Vite. The following instructions will guide you through the steps to clone the repository, set up the project, and run it on your local machine.

### Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your local machine:

## Git: Version control system to clone repositories.
Node.js: JavaScript runtime environment. It's recommended to use the latest LTS version.
npm (comes with Node.js) or yarn: Package manager to install dependencies.
Getting Started

### Clone the Repository
To clone the repository to your local machine, open your terminal and run the following command:

bash: 
git clone <url of git repo>

### Navigate to the Project Directory
After cloning the repository, navigate to the project's directory:

cd repository-name

### Install Dependencies

Once inside the project directory, install the project dependencies:

Using npm:

npm install
Or using yarn:
yarn install
This command will install all the required packages as listed in the package.json file.

4. Run the Development Server
After the dependencies are installed, you can run the development server. Vite will start a local server, and you can view the application in your browser.

Using npm:

bash
Copy code
npm run dev
Or using yarn:

bash
Copy code
yarn dev
5. Open the Application
Once the server is running, you can open your web browser and navigate to:

arduino
Copy code
http://localhost:5173
This will load the React application in your browser.

6. Building for Production
To create an optimized build for production, run the following command:

Using npm:

bash
Copy code
npm run build
Or using yarn:

bash
Copy code
yarn build
The build output will be located in the dist/ directory.

7. Previewing the Production Build
You can preview the production build locally to ensure everything works as expected:

Using npm:

bash
Copy code
npm run preview
Or using yarn:

bash
Copy code
yarn preview
8. Additional Notes
If you encounter any issues, make sure that your Node.js and npm/yarn versions are up to date.
